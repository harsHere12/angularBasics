# Angular Learning Journey
Welcome to my Angular learning repository! This repo is dedicated to my journey as I learn and experiment with Angular, building applications and understanding the framework in-depth.

Overview
This repository will contain code, experiments, and notes as I explore Angular. My primary focus is to gain hands-on experience with Angular concepts such as:

Components
Modules
Services
Routing
Forms
HTTP Client
Observables and RxJS
Angular CLI
Testing (Unit and E2E)
Goals
Understand the core concepts of Angular and how to build scalable web applications.
Experiment with Angular services, routing, forms, and RxJS.
Push my code, projects, and learning resources to the repo.
Work on small to mid-sized Angular projects.
